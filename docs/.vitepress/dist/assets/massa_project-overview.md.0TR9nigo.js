In the following sections, we will explore each of these aspects in more detail, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of the project.</p><h2 id="what-is-massa-network" tabindex="-1">What is Massa Network <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-massa-network" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Massa Network&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://massa.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Massa Network</a> is a new blockchain project that aims to provide a more decentralized and scalable network with high throughput. It is <a href="https://massa.net/technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">designed</a> to support up to 10,000 transactions per second using autonomous smart contracts and runs on the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm.</p><p>Massa Network represents a <a href="https://massa.net/vision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">transformative approach</a> to blockchain technology, prioritizing the interests of its users. Rooted in the principles of transparency and security, Massa Network aims to reshape the dynamics of decentralized networks. It distinguishes itself as the <a href="https://massalabs.medium.com/decentralization-is-non-negotiable-f9b180e05a04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">first truly decentralized blockchain</a>, designed to empower its community while delivering top-tier performance and security. One standout feature is its Nakamoto coefficient, surpassing 1,000, signifying a robust <a href="https://twitter.com/MassaLabs/status/1686305919972306945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">distribution of power</a>.</p><h2 id="massa-network-technology" tabindex="-1">Massa Network Technology <a class="header-anchor" href="#massa-network-technology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Massa Network Technology&quot;">​</a></h2><p>At the heart of Massa Network&#39;s technology stack are two groundbreaking innovations. First, Massa introduces <a href="https://massa.net/autonomous-sc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Autonomous Smart Contracts</a> (ASCs), capable of self-activation based on predefined conditions, eliminating the need for continuous centralized monitoring. Second, the platform pioneers on-chain web functionality, enabling DApp front-ends to reside on *.massa domains, ensuring transparency and immutability. These innovations collectively foster a safer and more authentic web3 experience.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="An image"></p><p>Accessibility is a core tenet of Massa Network, allowing anyone to participate in securing the network with minimal hardware and token requirements. Smart contract <a href="https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">development</a> is simplified with TypeScript, a familiar language for web2 developers.</p><h2 id="current-stage-of-development" tabindex="-1">Current Stage of Development <a class="header-anchor" href="#current-stage-of-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Current Stage of Development&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Massa Network has achieved significant technical milestones and testnet enhancements driven by the community since its inception in 2017. The project is preparing for its mainnet launch, expected in Q4 2023, accompanied by the establishment of the Massa Foundation and listing on exchanges to connect with the broader blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>Following the mainnet launch, Massa plans to integrate on-chain governance in 2024, giving the community the power to independently steer the project&#39;s direction. Technical upgrades will be driven by community decisions, focusing on scalability and user experience enhancements, such as L2 and sharding solutions and decentralized interoperability.</p><p>By year eight of the mainnet, the decentralization program will conclude, marking the ultimate step towards full community control and realizing the project&#39;s vision of a truly decentralized future.</p><h2 id="team-and-backers" tabindex="-1">Team and Backers <a class="header-anchor" href="#team-and-backers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Team and Backers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The driving force behind Massa Network is a team of visionaries and seasoned professionals. Founded by Sébastien, Damir, and Adrien in 2017, Massa&#39;s journey began as a research endeavor focused on consensus protocols.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="An image" data-zoomable=""></p><p>This team&#39;s background includes significant contributions to the blockchain space, including the development of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and leadership roles at Tendermint.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, Massa Network emerges as a trailblazing project that challenges the status quo of centralized systems. Its commitment to decentralization, innovative technology, and fair token distribution sets the stage for a decentralized web3 future. Massa Network is not merely a project but a vision for a more inclusive and transparent decentralized ecosystem.</p><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Resources&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://massa.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/massalabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/massa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/massalabs/massa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a></li><li><a href="https://massalabs.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Docs</a></li></ul>',23),l=[c];function h(d,m,p,u,f,g){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const w=e(i,[["render",h]]);export{k as __pageData,w as default};
