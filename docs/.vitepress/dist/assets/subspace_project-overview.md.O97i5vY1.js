In the following sections, we will explore each of these aspects in more detail, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of the project.</p><h2 id="what-is-subspace" tabindex="-1">What is Subspace <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-subspace" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Subspace&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://subspace.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Subspace</a> is a fourth generation blockchain network designed to address some of the fundamental challenges faced by existing blockchain systems. It aims to create a highly secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain infrastructure while maintaining eco-friendliness and permissionless.</p><p>Subspace introduces a novel consensus mechanism called <a href="https://subspace.network/technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Proof-of-Archival-Storage</a> (PoAS), which replaces energy-intensive mining with storage-intensive farming. This unique approach incentivizes network participants to store and maintain the blockchain&#39;s entire history, ensuring its availability and security.</p><p>Furthermore, Subspace separates consensus and computation, enabling horizontal scaling and accommodating the growing demands of Web3 applications. With its commitment to resolving the blockchain trilemma and fostering broad participation, Subspace aims to facilitate the next wave of innovation in the crypto space.</p><h2 id="proof-of-archival-storage-poas-consensus" tabindex="-1">Proof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS) Consensus <a class="header-anchor" href="#proof-of-archival-storage-poas-consensus" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS) Consensus&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Subspace introduces a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS). PoAS is designed to maintain the security and permissionless nature of Nakamoto consensus (used in Bitcoin) without the massive electricity consumption associated with mining.</p><p>Here&#39;s how PoAS works:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Plotting Space:</strong> Farmers, participants in the Subspace network, write small pieces of data to their available storage space. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Space (PoS) mechanisms, Subspace&#39;s plotting process doesn&#39;t fill storage with random data but creates unique partial replicas of historical data. This allows anyone worldwide to pledge their free storage space and participate in consensus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Farming Blocks:</strong> Subspace constructs a secure randomness beacon from the blockchain&#39;s history itself. Farmers scan their plots for specific data chunks and compile them into a Proof-of-Replication (PoR) to produce the next block in the chain. This process is lightweight in terms of storage and computing overhead.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintaining Security:</strong> To prevent attacks, Subspace uses various techniques, such as reusing blockchain history entropy, segregating PoRs, and employing a Proof-of-Time mechanism based on AES-128. These measures safeguard against simulation, grinding, compression, long-range, and bribing attacks.</p></li></ul><h2 id="stage-of-development" tabindex="-1">Stage of Development <a class="header-anchor" href="#stage-of-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stage of Development&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Subspace Network is currently experiencing exciting developments as it recently unveiled Gemini III, the third and final incentivized test network leading up to the highly anticipated Mainnet Beta launch. This significant milestone marks a crucial step towards establishing Subspace as the world&#39;s foremost open identity and payment network, bridging the gap between humans and AI through cutting-edge Web3 technology. With a steadfast commitment to scalability, security, and decentralization, Subspace is poised to revolutionize the digital economy.</p><p>The team is actively engaged in implementing technical upgrades and releasing new products in preparation for the Mainnet Beta launch scheduled for 2024.</p><h2 id="backers" tabindex="-1">Backers <a class="header-anchor" href="#backers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Backers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Subspace Labs, the developer of the Subspace Network, has raised over $38M in a few financing rounds, which includes a special grant for research and development (R&amp;D). The funding round was led by Pantera Capital and attracted participation from well-known investors such as Coinbase Ventures, <a href="http://crypto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Crypto.com</a>, Alameda Research, ConsenSys Mesh, and others.</p><a class="external-link" href="https://blog.subspace.network/subspace-labs-raises-32-9-million-to-bring-internet-scale-to-web3-b0fdd4dffe7e"><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:left;margin-left:1rem;"><p>Subspace Labs Raises $32.9 Million to Bring Internet Scale to Web3</p><p style="margin-top:-1rem;">blog.subspace.network</p></div></a><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Resources&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://subspace.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/NetworkSubspace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/subspace-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.subspace.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/subspace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a></li></ul>',20),n=[o];function c(l,p,h,d,u,g){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(r,[["render",c]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
