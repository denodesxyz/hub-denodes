In the following sections, we will explore each of these aspects in more detail, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of the Namada network.</p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://namada.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Namada</a> is a decentralized blockchain project that aims to provide asset-agnostic, interchain privacy through its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) layer 1 protocol. The project focuses on ensuring privacy, scalability, and decentralization in blockchain transactions.</p><p>The <a href="https://namada.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Namada</a> protocol stands out from other blockchain projects due to several unique features. These include:</p><ul><li>Asset-agnostic privacy for all types of transactions makes it an ideal solution for a wide range of use cases.</li><li>Interoperability across multiple blockchains, enabling seamless transfers of assets across different platforms.</li><li>Scalable throughput through advanced techniques such as sharding and off-chain computation ensures that the network can handle high volumes of transactions.</li></ul><h2 id="what-is-namada" tabindex="-1">What is Namada? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-namada" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Namada?&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://x.com/namada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Namada Network</a> is designed to provide a secure and private way to make shielded transfers with any kind of asset, whether fungible or non-fungible, across different chains and platforms. The network achieves decentralization by using a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. This algorithm motivates validators to act honestly by implementing a system of rewards and penalties.</p><p>In addition to its privacy-focused approach, Namada Network is also focused on scalability. The network achieves this through the use of innovative techniques such as sharding and off-chain computation, which enable it to handle high volumes of transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization.</p><a class="external-link" href="https://namada.net/blog/what-is-namada"><div style="width:10%;"><img src="https://namada.net/assets/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="namada-icon" style=""></div><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:left;margin-left:1rem;"><p>What is Namada? | Blog - Namada</p><p style="margin-top:-1rem;">namada</p></div></a><h2 id="namada-technology" tabindex="-1">Namada Technology <a class="header-anchor" href="#namada-technology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Namada Technology&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Namada aims to unify fragmented privacy sets by creating a single, asset-agnostic shielded pool that can accommodate all tokens, both fungible and non-fungible, across different chains and platforms. This unification is achieved through mechanisms such as the MASP/CC circuits and IBC-enabled bridges, which enable users to move assets into the unified shielded set and enhance privacy.</p><p>Additionally, Namada introduces the concept of &quot;shielded actions,&quot; allowing users to interact privately with various chains and dApps. These shielded actions, supported by Namada&#39;s innovative design, facilitate secure transactions even between chains that may not inherently support privacy.</p><p>To incentivize the adoption of shielded transfers and privacy features, Namada offers shielded set rewards. Users who choose to keep different assets in the shielded set are rewarded, encouraging the use of privacy-preserving functions.</p><p>One of Namada&#39;s significant contributions is the concept of shared privacy. Through private bridges, Namada can connect diverse privacy chains, creating a more extensive multichain privacy set that enhances privacy guarantees for all users. Private bridges also improve the user experience by eliminating the need to unshield assets when moving between chains.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="An image" data-zoomable=""></p><h2 id="backers-team" tabindex="-1">Backers &amp; Team <a class="header-anchor" href="#backers-team" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Backers &amp; Team&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://anoma.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anoma Foundation</a>, coordinating the development of <a href="http://anoma.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anoma</a> and <a href="https://namada.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Namada</a>, successfully raised over $57 million in three fundraising rounds.</p><p>This substantial financial support came from a diverse group of investors, including Delphi Digital, Dialectic, KR1, Spartan, NGC, MH Ventures, Bixin Ventures, No Limit, WAGMI, Plassa, Perridon Ventures, Anagram, Factor, and over 30 angels.</p><p>The latest round of fundraising was co-led by returning fund CMCC Global and Electric Capital, which has supported <a href="http://anoma.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anoma</a> in all previous rounds.</p><a class="external-link" href="https://namada.net/blog/what-is-namada"><div style="width:9%;height:50%;background-color:rgba(34,46,57,1.00);border-radius:50%;"><img src="https://anoma.foundation/favicon.ico" alt="namada-icon" style="width:100%;"></div><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:left;margin-left:1rem;"><p>Anoma Foundation</p><p style="margin-top:-1rem;">anomafoundation</p></div></a><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Resources&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://namada.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/namada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/namada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/anoma/namada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.namada.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Documentation</a></li></ul>',25),l=[s];function c(d,h,p,m,u,f){return e(),t("div",null,l)}const b=a(o,[["render",c]]);export{v as __pageData,b as default};
